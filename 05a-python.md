For quick and easy interactive practice with Python, many people enjoy [Codecademy's Python track](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/python). There's also [Learn Python The Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/) and [The Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/).

### Q1. Lists &amp; Tuples

How are Python lists and tuples similar and different? Which will work as keys in dictionaries? Why?

>> Lists and tuples are the same in that they are containers. They can hold a sequence of objects and support elements of any type and maintain order. Lists can be identified in syntax via the [] while tuples use (). Inside both container, commas are used to separate the elements from one another. Tuples are immutable and thus their elements cannot be altered. For these reasons methods such as .append() don't exist in tuples. They also are more memory efficient since its length is set. Lists are mutable and can be changed and thus have many methods that can alter its contents available to it. Because its length can change at any given time, memory allocation is generous to accomodate for methods such as append(). Since only immutable objects can be keys in a dictionary, tuples are best suited for this job. In order for a list to be used as keys in a dictionary, these need to be first converted to tuples.

### Q2. Lists &amp; Sets

How are Python lists and sets similar and different? Give examples of using both. How does performance compare between lists and sets for finding an element. Why?

>> Lists and sets are the same in that they are both containers. I went into a bit of detail in the previous question about lists. Sets contain unordered unique elements since sets cannot contain duplicates. Sets have methods to alter the contents and operations such as intersection, union, difference, and symmetric difference (operations of math's set theory). It uses {} as its syntax. As far as performance, sets are faster when looking for an element in the container using "in". However, looping through it is much slower than that in a list.
